### Abstract

## I. Introduction

Reliable, high-speed internet access is an essential resource for
today's college works and studies, where assignments, entertainment,
socialization, and more has been migrated to online platforms such as
Moodle and Google services. Yet not all students enjoy equal access to
robust networks on Augustana College campuses. This inequality manifests
itself glaringly in WI-Fi infrastructure quality at academic buildings
on campus. Through a comparative analysis of WI-Fi speeds conducted
between only two locations, our project aimed to test our claim about
the inequality of the WI-fi speed in science and humanities buildings.

Within a week period, our team performed Wi-Fi speed tests between
morning to afternoon over two locations: one in Hanson Hall (science
building) and one in Old Main Hall (humanities). We recorded download
and upload speeds using Augustana home grown Internet Speed Test,
averaging 32 test results from 2 spots within two buildings. Our central
hypotheses were twofold: that average download speeds would prove
significantly faster in STEM-focused Hanson versus Old Main, and upload
speed also faster in Hanson than Old Main.

Our study provides compelling evidence of major infrastructure biases
against academic disciplines seemingly "softer" or less valued than
technical fields within the institutional technology status quo.
Addressing deficiencies uncovered should constitute an urgent priority
for equitable distribution of campus network resources benefiting all
students.

## II. Experimental Setup

```{r}
# get the differece between download and upload speeds for each building
result <-
  data.frame(
    download_diff = hanson_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)` - oldmain_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`,
    upload_diff = hanson_data$`Upload Speed (Mbps)` - oldmain_data$`Upload Speed (Mbps)`
  )

```

Here is a summary of the data:

```{r}
h_download_mean = mean(hanson_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
h_upload_mean = mean(hanson_data$`Upload Speed (Mbps)`)
h_download_sd = sd(hanson_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
h_upload_sd = sd(hanson_data$`Upload Speed (Mbps)`)
```

```{r}
o_download_mean = mean(oldmain_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
o_upload_mean = mean(oldmain_data$`Upload Speed (Mbps)`)
o_download_sd = sd(oldmain_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
o_upload_sd = sd(oldmain_data$`Upload Speed (Mbps)`)
```

```{r}
summary(result$download_diff)
```

```{r}
summary(result$upload_diff)
```

Now to get some of the statistics:

```{r}
download_sd <- sd(result$download_diff)
download_mean <- mean(result$download_diff)

upload_sd <- sd(result$upload_diff)
upload_mean <- mean(result$upload_diff)

#use ggplot2
library(ggplot2)

plot_dist_hist <- function(n, mean, sd, binwidth) {
  df <- data.frame(x = rnorm(n, mean, sd))
  ggplot(df, aes(
    x = x,
    mean = mean,
    sd = sd,
    binwidth = binwidth,
    n = n
  )) +
    theme_bw() +
    geom_histogram(
      binwidth = binwidth,
      colour = "white",
      fill = "cornflowerblue",
      linewidth = 0.1
    ) +
    stat_function(
      fun = function(x)
        dnorm(x, mean = mean, sd = sd) * n * binwidth,
      color = "darkred",
      linewidth = 1
    ) + 
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
}
n = nrow(result)
binwidth = 60 # passed to geom_histogram and stat_function
set.seed(1)

plot_dist_hist(n, download_mean, download_sd, binwidth) + labs(title = "Plot of Average   Download Speed Difference Distribution", x = "Speed (Mbps)", y = "Occurance")

plot_dist_hist(n, upload_mean, upload_sd, binwidth) + labs(title = "Plot of Average Upload Speed Difference Distribution",x ="Speed (Mbps)", y = "Occurance")

```

## III. Results

```{r}
# Given data
n <- 16  # Sample size for each building
h_download_mean <- mean(hanson_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
o_download_mean <- mean(oldmain_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
h_download_sd <-  sd(hanson_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
o_download_sd <- sd(oldmain_data$`Download Speed (Mbps)`)
```

$Calculation of Mean Difference and Standard Deviation$ The mean
difference and the standard deviation of the difference in download
speeds are calculated as follows:

```{r}
# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the difference in download speeds
o_mean_diff <- h_download_mean - o_download_mean
o_sd_diff <- sqrt((h_download_sd^2 / n) + (o_download_sd^2 / n))
o_mean_diff
```

$mean_diff$ = 22.8325 $sd_diff$ = 30.15495

##Statistical Testing of Mean Difference of Download Speeds To test the
significance of the difference, we calculate the t-statistic and the
corresponding p-value:

```{r}
t_statistic <- o_mean_diff / o_sd_diff
df <- n - 1  # Degrees of freedom

# Calculate the p-value
p_value <- 2 * (1- pt(t_statistic,df))
p_value
```

$p_(value)$ = 0.4606757

##Meaning of P_value The p-value of 0.4606757 is greater than the
significance level of 0.05. This indicates that the observed difference
in WiFi speeds between Hanson Hall and Old Main Hall is not
statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Hence we accept
the null hypothesis.

###To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference between
the true means of download speeds from Hanson Hall and Old Main Hall\$:

```{r}

# Calculate the t-value for a 95% confidence interval
t_value <- qt(0.975, df)

```

###Calculate the confidence interval for mean difference of download
speeds.

```{r}
# Calculate the margin of error
margin_error <- t_value * sd_diff

# Calculate the confidence interval
ci_lower <- o_mean_diff - margin_error
ci_upper <- o_mean_diff + margin_error

# Output the confidence interval
list(lower_bound = ci_lower, upper_bound = ci_upper)
ci_lower
ci_upper
```

The 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean download speeds
between Hanson Hall and Old Main Hall, given as approximately
[-41.44125, 87.10625] Mbps.

##Statistical Testing of Mean Difference of Upload Speeds To test the
significance of the difference, we calculate the t-statistic and the
corresponding p-value:

```{r}
u_mean_diff <- h_upload_mean - o_upload_mean
u_sd_diff <- sqrt((h_upload_sd^2 / n) + (o_upload_sd^2 / n))
t_statistic <- u_mean_diff / u_sd_diff
df <- n - 1  # Degrees of freedom

# Calculate the p-value
p_value <- 2 * (1- pt(t_statistic,df))
p_value
```

$p_(value)$ = 0.7647606

##Meaning of P_value The p-value of 0.7647606 is greater than the
significance level of 0.05. This indicates that the observed difference
in WiFi speeds between Hanson Hall and Old Main Hall is not
statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Hence we accept
the null hypothesis.

###To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference between
the true means of upload speeds from Hanson Hall and Old Main Hall:

```{r}

# Calculate the t-value for a 95% confidence interval
t_value <- qt(0.975, df)

# Calculate the margin of error
margin_error <- t_value * u_sd_diff

# Calculate the confidence interval
ci_lower <- u_mean_diff - margin_error
ci_upper <- u_mean_diff + margin_error

# Output the confidence interval
list(lower_bound = ci_lower, upper_bound = ci_upper)
ci_lower
ci_upper
```

The 95% confidence interval for the difference in mean download speeds
between Hanson Hall and Old Main Hall, given as approximately [-57.7842,
77.06295] Mbps. \## IV. Discussion
